### Dataset
The dataset used in this case study contains medical images and corresponding labels indicating whether a tumor is present or not. It includes the following features:

• Image Data: The medical images (e.g., MRI scans).
• Labels: A binary label indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of a tumor.


#### Libraries Used
The following Python libraries are used in this project:

• Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
• NumPy: For numerical operations.
• Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
• Scikit-learn: For building machine learning models.
• TensorFlow/Keras (if deep learning models are used).
###Modeling Process
The process of building the tumor detection model follows these steps:

1. Data Exploration: Initial exploration to understand the dataset.
2. Data Preprocessing: Steps include image resizing, normalization, and splitting into training and testing sets.
3. Feature Engineering: Extracting meaningful features from the image data.
4. Model Training: Using machine learning algorithms (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM) or deep learning models (e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks) to train the detection model.
5. Evaluation: Measuring the model’s performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. Visualization: Plotting confusion matrices, ROC curves, and other visualizations for analysis.
### Usage
To use the notebook:

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook.
